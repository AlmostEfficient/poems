    "content": "Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,\nAnd sorry I could not travel both\nAnd be one traveler, long I stood\nAnd looked down one as far as I could\nTo where it bent in the undergrowth;\n\nThen took the other, as just as fair,\nAnd having perhaps the better claim,\nBecause it was grassy and wanted wear;\nThough as for that the passing there\nHad worn them really about the same,\n\nAnd both that morning equally lay\nIn leaves no step had trodden black.\nOh, I kept the first for another day!\nYet knowing how way leads on to way,\nI doubted if I should ever be back.\n\nI shall be telling this with a sigh\nSomewhere ages and ages hence:\nTwo roads diverged in a wood, and I—\nI took the one less traveled by,\nAnd that has made all the difference."

    "content": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n\"'Tis some visitor,\" I muttered, \"tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.\"\n\nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n\nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n\"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.\"\n\nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n\"Sir,\" said I, \"or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you\"—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more."

Near them, on the sand,\nHalf sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,\nAnd wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,\nTell that its sculptor well those passions read\nWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,\nThe hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;\nAnd on the pedestal, these words appear:\nMy name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;\nLook on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!\nNothing beside remains. Round the decay\nOf that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare\nThe lone and level sands stretch far away.\""
